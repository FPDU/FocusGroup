With any surgery, there is a risk of infection. Surgery might also cause short-term pain.\r\n\r\n###**Number of incisions**\r\nIf surgery is needed, there might be one or several incisions (cuts with a surgical tool) into your residual hand, arm, shoulder, or back. After surgery, each incision may require some care. There may be short-term pain in the area around each incision. With each incision, there is also a risk of infection.\r\n\r\n###**Size of incisions**\r\nIf surgery is needed, there might be small or large incisions (cuts with a surgical tool) into your residual hand, arm, shoulder, or back. Large incisions may cause large scars that last for months or years.\r\n\r\n###**Whether you stay at the hospital after surgery**\r\nWith some of the new prostheses, you may be able to leave the hospital on the same day. With some other types of new prostheses, you may need to stay in the hospital for a few days to recover.\r\n\r\n###**Restrictions after surgery**\r\nThe length of time you will have limitations after the surgery. These might be limitations on movement or prosthesis use. They could last for days, weeks, or months, depending on the type of new prosthesis you get.\r\n\r\n###**Device location**\r\nWhere the medical devices for controlling the prosthesis and giving you a sense of touch are located. Some current prostheses use sensors on the skin surface. Using these prostheses does not require surgery. New prostheses may place medical devices inside the arm or in the back. These devices may be attached to muscles, nerves, or the spinal cord.\r\n\r\n###**Risk of device implantation**\r\nThe risks associated with having surgery and placing the medical devices in your body. These risks might include:\r\n* Long-term pain.\r\n* Shortening the remaining limb.\r\n* Cutting a nerve. You could lose some muscle control or some of your sense of touch.\r\n* Device failure.  You may have to have more surgery to have the device removed or repaired.\r\n\r\n###**Experiences during recovery from surgery**\r\nWhile you recover from surgery, you may:\r\n* Have pain\r\n* Have weakness in your arm\r\n* Feel different or unusual sensations in your arm\r\n* Be unable to wear a prosthesis\r\n\r\n###**Long-term limitations**\r\nAs a result of having a medical device inside your body, you may be unable to have:\r\n* *Additional implanted prostheses:* The prosthesis you choose may become outdated. Because of the surgeries you have gone through, you may not be a candidate for even newer prostheses.\r\n* *An implanted neural stimulator:* Neural stimulators are used to help with bladder or bowel control, to treat muscle tremors, or to treat long-term pain.\r\n* *An implanted cardiac device:* Cardiac devices are used to treat many heart conditions. For example, they might restart the heart after a heart attack.\r\n* *An implanted drug pump:* Drug pumps are used to deliver medication for long-term pain.\r\n* *An MRI scan:* MRI scans may help with diagnosing many diseases, such as stroke, heart disease, cancer, pain, and Alzheimerâ€™s disease.\r\n\r\n###**Risk of deciding not to use the prosthesis**\r\nAfter you have surgery and learn to use the new prosthesis, you may decide you do not like the new prosthesis enough to use it. About 20 out of 100 people decide to stop using current prostheses that do not require surgery. The risk with new prostheses may be lower, the same, or higher.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
